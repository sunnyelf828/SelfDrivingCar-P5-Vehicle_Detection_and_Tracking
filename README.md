# SelfDrivingCar-P5-Vehicle_Detection_and_Tracking

## The Project

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

- Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
- Apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
- After those first two steps, also normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
- Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
- Run the pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles. （Adding Smooth function to accelerate the calculation）
- Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.
- Further improvment should be work on the smooth function
